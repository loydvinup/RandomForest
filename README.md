Customer Churn Prediction - Random Forest Classifier
Dataset Overview

This project uses the Customer Churn dataset (customer_churn.csv), which contains telecom customer details. The dataset includes information about contract types, service usage, and billing details to predict whether a customer will churn.
Key Features:

    Tenure ‚Äì Duration of customer subscription
    TotalCharges ‚Äì Total amount charged
    TechSupport, InternetService, Contract Type ‚Äì Service-related features
    Churn (Target Variable) ‚Äì 1 = Churned, 0 = Retained

Approach Used
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing

    Handled missing values (TotalCharges) by imputing the mean
    Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
    Dropped irrelevant columns like customerID

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Checked data distributions and outliers
    Visualized feature distributions and churn rates using seaborn

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training - Random Forest Classifier

    Implemented RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn
    Used train-test split (70-30) for model training
    Tuned n_estimators (number of trees) to optimize performance

4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation & Results

    Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
    Visualized performance using a confusion matrix heatmap

Technologies Used

üöÄ Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
